# Todos

Todos App is a good example of application to demonstrate a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using any programming language.

As a developer, i love learning new programming languages and frameworks. So in this repository, i will try to implement the same application using different programming languages and frameworks.

### Todo Model

A `Todo` is a simple model with the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier of the todo
- `label`: Label of the todo
- `completed`: Status of the todo (completed or not)


### Todo API

The API of the application is very simple and has the following endpoints:

- `GET /todos`: List all todos
- `POST /todos`: Create a new todo
- `GET /todos/:id`: Get a todo by id
- `PUT /todos/:id`: Update a todo by id
- `DELETE /todos/:id`: Delete a todo by id

### Todo UI

The UI of the application is very simple and has only one page with the following features:

- List all todos
- Create a new todo
- Edit an existing todo label
- Mark a todo as completed
- Delete a todo
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
    <img alt="todo view" style="border: 0; margin-left: 50px" src="assets/todo-ui.png" width="700px"/>
</div>

#### ðŸ›µ How to run the application ?

If you have `makefile` installed on your machine, you can run the following command to build and run the application:

````shell
 cd golang-edgeDB-angular && make build_and_run
````

or you can run the following commands:

````shell
cd golang-edgeDB-angular/front \
  && ng build  --output-path ../back/static \
  && cd ../back \
  && go run main.go
````
then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

<img src="assets/go.png" style="width: 25px"> In this example, i've used <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> as a backend language and <a href="https://gofiber.io/">Fiber v2 </a> framework to build the API.
Since I used version 1.20 of Golang, it was an opportunity to test the use of `generics` that appeared in version 1.18. 

An example of usage of generics in the project ðŸ‘‡

```go
package utils

type (
	Consumer[T any] func(T) error
	Supplier[T any] func() (T, error)
)

func HandleSup[T any](supplier Supplier[T], consumer Consumer[T]) error {
	if t, err := supplier(); err != nil {
		return err
	} else {
		return consumer(t)
	}
}
```



<img src="assets/edgedb.png" style="width: 30px"> To store the data, i've chosen <a href="https://edgedb.com/">EdgeDB</a> as a database. It is a new database built on top of PostgreSQL. 
It is a very interesting database with a really nice type system an a powerful query language. 

An example of schema to define the Todo model ðŸ‘‡
``` sql
module default {

    type Todo {
        required label: str {
            constraint min_len_value(1);
        }
        completed: bool {
            default := false;
        }
        
        constraint exclusive on ( str_trim( str_lower( .label ) ) );
    }
}
```

An example of query to get a todo by id ðŸ‘‡
```sql
SELECT default::Todo {
    id,
    label,
    completed
} FILTER .id = <uuid>$0;
```

and to check if a todo with a specific label exists:

``` sql
SELECT count( 
    (SELECT default::Todo FILTER .lable = <str>$0)
) > 0;
```

I highly recommend you to check it out ðŸ˜‰.

<img src="assets/angular.png" style="width: 20px"> For the frontend, i've used <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> framework, 
<a href="https://angular.io/guide/signals">Angular Signals</a> instead of <a href="https://rxjs.dev/">RxJS</a>
and <a href="https://ngrx.io/">NgRx</a> to manage the state of the application with Redux pattern.

<img src="assets/rust.png" style="width: 20px"> For this second implementation of the todo-app, i've choosen <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust programming language</a>. It's not the easiest one but i love it. I've already try it before, but this time i've decided to give a try to one of its most popular web framework : <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket rs</a>. It's a really good framework that provide `derive macros` to easily write API endpoints.  

````rust
#[post("/", data = "<request>")]

<img src="assets/elm.png" style="width: 20px"> What's about <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>? Elm is defined by its creator as <code>a delightful language for reliable web applications</code>. In fact, Elm is a functional, typed and error free language. As a Java developer, I am not really familiar with Functional Languages even if i've already tried languages Ã  <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> or <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. But Elm is really easy to learn. And any developer can learn and write elm code in few days.

I've choose Elm to this implementation because, this language is really awesome. Like Rust, it is `error free`, that mean that if your code compile, it could not fail at runtime. It's perfect to write robust web applications ðŸ¦¾.


```elm
filterBarView : FilterOption -> Html TodoActions
filterBarView option =
    let
        classes =
            case option of
                All ->
                    ( filterOptionClass ++ " " ++ filterActiveClass, filterOptionClass )

                Completed ->
                    ( filterOptionClass, filterOptionClass ++ " " ++ filterActiveClass )
    in
    div [ class filterBlocClass ]
        [ span [ class <| Tuple.first classes, onClick <| ChangeFilter All ] [ text "View All" ]
        , div [ class filterDividerClass ] []
        , span [ class <| Tuple.second classes, onClick <| ChangeFilter Completed ] [ text "Completed" ]

- **Frontend**: [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)

- **Database**: [bun:sqlite](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite)


#### ðŸ›µ How to run the application ?

First, you need to install `bun` on your machine. 

Follow the instructions on the [bun documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) to install it.

Then, you can run the following command to build and run the application:

````shell
 cd Bun-ElysiaJs-HTMX && bun dev
````

then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

<img src="assets/bun.png" style="width: 20px"> What's <strong>Bun</strong>?

``
Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.
``

It's a new tool that i've discovered recently. It's a perfect tool to build web applications. It's really easy to use and it's really fast.

For the third implementation of the todo-app, i've decided to use Bun as my application runtime. 

It is possible to build a rest api server with bun as follows:

```typescript
const server = Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Welcome to Bun!");
  },
});
```
But i prefer to use  <a href="https://elysiajs.com">Elysia Js</a> framework to write my endpoints.

<img src="assets/elysia.png" style="width: 20px"> <strong>Elysia</strong> Js is a really fast and easy to use web framework. Faster than Nest, Express, Fastify, FastApi, Spring or Gin frameworks.

Elysia app (_powered by bun_) can be easily created with bun by running : ```bun create elysia```

If you are familiar with any web framework you will easily understand how to use Elysia Js.

```typescript
const app = new Elysia()
    .get('/', 'Hello World')
    .get('/json', {
        hello: 'world'
    })
    .get('/id/:id', ({ params: { id } }) => id)
    .post('/profile', ({ body }) => body,
        {
            body: t.Object({
                username: t.String()
            })
        }
    )
    .listen(3000)
```

<img src="assets/htmx.png" style="width: 20px"> <strong>HTMX</strong> is a new tool that i've discovered recently. It's a really cool tool that allow you to build web applications with less javascript code. 

```
htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext
