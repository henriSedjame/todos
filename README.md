# Todos

Todos App is a good example of application to demonstrate a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using any programming language.

As a developer, i love learning new programming languages and frameworks. So in this repository, i will try to implement the same application using different programming languages and frameworks.

### Todo Model

A `Todo` is a simple model with the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier of the todo
- `label`: Label of the todo
- `completed`: Status of the todo (completed or not)


### Todo API

The API of the application is very simple and has the following endpoints:

- `GET /todos`: List all todos
- `POST /todos`: Create a new todo
- `GET /todos/:id`: Get a todo by id
- `PUT /todos/:id`: Update a todo by id
- `DELETE /todos/:id`: Delete a todo by id

### Todo UI

The UI of the application is very simple and has only one page with the following features:

- List all todos
- Create a new todo
- Edit an existing todo label
- Mark a todo as completed
- Delete a todo
